## Getting Started

First, you will need a `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file to run this locally.

You can then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

## How does it work?

This app uses OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and Vercel Edge functions with streaming.
